    "I really wanted to like this game as I enjoyed the first one on the switch. Problem is, tears is FAR more difficult than the original. It’s not a casual game at all anymore. It takes far too much time, effort, research (online) to figure out where to find hidden areas and there are lots of “stuck points” (dead ends) that have no way of getting out except going to previous game save.\n",

    "2. The first Zelda showed what/where you’re supposed to do/get to in a shrine via a quick cut scene. This one does none of that. What’s worse, is that on the sky island, you’re actually given a new power and then if you leave (because the puzzle is obscenely hidden) - you don’t actually have the power. Puzzles are 10x’s harder. Example of nearly impossible puzzles use the rewind power (talk about next level difficulty: there’s a two clock handle gate puzzle that took me two days to get through. One puzzle!)\n",
    "3. Far more fighting/combat. Takes away the fun experience of exploring and talking to people doing side quests. And combat is just far more difficult in this game. The first robot shrine to train you, is just hard/horrible for a first tutorial.\n",
    "4. Sky island (first zone) is just overall at a ridiculously high level of difficulty. I got so disappointed (too much running around and end areas/or falling) that I abandoned the game for a few weeks and eventually came back. I had to watch several YouTube videos to figure out where the 4th shrine entrance was in a dark cave.\n",

    "I have been a Zelda fan all the way back to playing Zelda 2 when I was 4. And when Breath of the Wild came out, I was blown away, but also frustrated by aspects of it. Yes the game did away with most of the standard Zelda formula, but enough still remained for me to enjoy it as a Zelda game. What blew me away though was the size of the game, the focus on exploration and many other things. However, many things frustrated me like how long it took to get around, warping to shrines was easy, but losing your horse was always a serious pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we arrive at the new game Tears of the Kingdom, clearly a sequel to BOTW that uses the same map, but manages to keep it fresh by introducing sky islands and the depths. And first off, if you felt BOTW had a massive map, this will blow you away. There is so much more to explore, but yet the game moves SO much faster by changing the towers from things you have to slowly climb to activate to just making them usually have a small puzzle to get them activated. Once you have these towers up, the game gets MUCH easier to navigate as each launches you miles into the sky where you can glide down toward the next closest one, or perhaps a shrine or other notable area. This eliminated the problem I had with horses and in fact, I barely used mine over the course of the entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new powers you gain at the start also open this up to a realm of creativity previously offered by other games like Minecraft, but in a Zelda game, it feels fresh. I can only say this game will feel like a dream to any engineers or someone with an interest in building. You can truly get lost in crafting weapons or vehicles, but even if only done when necessary it’s a lot of fun. I who think the shrine puzzles have gotten much harder (at least for someone like me), but they were still fun and brilliant to experience.\n",

    "This book is so utterly pretentiousness and trying so hard to be woke that I should have given up on it instead of seeing it to the end. I would have if the beginning hadn’t been so beautifully done. There’s a line in the book about a video game sequel being awful because it was farmed out to Indian programmers who had no interest in the game and that’s how this book feels after the incredible start. The beginning was layered, nuanced and artfully done. I hate flashbacks but this book had managed to layer the present, past and future in such an incredible way before it fell off a cliff and suddenly feels like an entirely different writer took over.\n",

    "The story began with Sadie and Sam central to the story. We found out about them in a narrative that skipped around in time to let us understand them and their relationship. Sam was the obviously the more sympathetic of the two and the one you as a reader care about. Sadie was often annoying and then fell apart in a ridiculous way. I hoped her awful college self with the horrible college boyfriend would evolve and grow up but she never does. Even worse for the story is the tangents that from that point became the story. We suddenly get a new character who is rightly called boring later on. He is a NPC. He’s just too good and uninteresting to take up so much space. We get his backstory we don’t need. In a similar way later on we get two new characters that happen to be gay that bring nothing to the story other than a celebration of their sexuality which apparently is worth their inclusion. Much like tangents about their game that take up unnecessary page time and continue to dilute any attempt at storytelling. There’s plenty of politics, even to a ridiculously degree like actual comical bad guys intent on violence against those in favor of gay relationships and marriage. Ironically for a book full of wokeness with characters never being straight, celebrating gender fluidity, the book managed to ridicule cultural appropriation. The book is very focused on the race of the characters but never explores them in more than a superficial way.\n",
    "One of the author’s worst faults was her pretentious word choices. Instead of writing in way that flowed she chose to constantly check her thesaurus for jarring words like jejune and verdigris every couple of pages. Ironically much like the criticism of a game her character created this book is pretentious and full of itself. The worst part is that could have been amazing if it had stayed as focused as it was in the beginning. This is not a story worth the journey so do not push play. I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.\n",

    "# A positive book review of Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow from Goodreads\n",
    "prompt4 = \"\"\"\n",
    "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, is a multilayered novel about friendship, love, and video games.\n",
    "Sam and Sadie met when they are kids and quickly bonded over their love of video games. They develop a friendship that spans almost 30 years. The novel follows the highs and lows of their friendship, including falling in love, falling out, a love triangle, successes, and failures. Throughout it all, the one constant in their lives is video games.\n",
    "The narrative alternates primarily between Sadie and Sam's POVs. Sam and Sadie are both loveable, arrogant, infuriating, and flawed. The dynamics of their friendship are complicated by love, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got a little sick of the friends to frenemies cycle between Sadie and Sam (more of Sadie’s anger towards Sam, but I understood her point of view). I loved them, but I also wanted to shake some sense in them.\n",
    "Sam’s mother, Anna; Marx, Sam’s college roommate; Dov, Sadie's professor; are some additional characters who make an impact. My favorite characters were Sam’s grandparents, Dong Hyun and Bong Cha.\n",
    "The novel blends reality and game worlds, and parts of the narrative take place in a virtual open world.\n",
    "All characters are well-developed and multidimensional. Even the avatars are multidimensional.\n",
    "I am not a huge fan of video games, but this book made me nostalgic for the video games of my childhood. I got all of the Oregon Trail and Mario references, but there were times that I was a little lost, but I didn’t mind because I learned so much about gaming. The reader doesn’t need to know much about video games to enjoy this book (but it might help!). There are also a lot of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references mixed in. I loved reading the details behind creating a game and the gaming industry as I was introduced to a whole new world.\n",
    "This is a well-written, complex, thought-provoking, and original novel. I was invested in the characters, and some moments hit me on an emotional level. I got teary-eyed towards the end. I won't forget these characters; this is a book that is going to stay with me for a long time.\n",
